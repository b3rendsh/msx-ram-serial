Fossil loader and drivers v1.40 which includes the 16550 driver.
Type: DRV140 HELP for help regarding use of optional commandline parameters.

-----------
Patched fossil driver 1.40 created by Roberto Vargas.
This version doesn't fully load basic to allocate memory for the driver and
automatically returns to the command prompt so you don't have to add the
optional parameter "_SYSTEM@ 
You can add other DOS commands e.g. type: DRV140P "_DIR@ to execute the DIR
command after the driver is loaded. The driver requires MSX-DOS 2.2 or 
higher. I have no further info or source code for this patch.
